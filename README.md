# Last Hope (Teaching Coding through Gaming)

Last Hope is a gaming-based code-learning framework. It's a Unity game I made for youngsters aged 12-19 to teach them coding while exploring the "Red Planet" in a NASA Mars rover. The framework was designed and made in support of the UK Government's Coding Curriculum school initiative.
